 The {@code GridLines_Config} class contains constants related to grid line configuration.
 <p>
 This class includes two static fields: {@link #GRID_WIDTH} and {@link #GRID_HEIGHT}.
 These fields specify the width and height of the grid lines, respectively, in floating-point units.
 </p>
 <p>
 This class is intended to be used as a utility class and thus does not provide a public constructor.
